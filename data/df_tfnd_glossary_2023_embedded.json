chains, including an organization\u2019s nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks and\/or opportunities, and responses to those issues. Affected communities can range from local communities living adjacent to the organization\u2019s operations or the site of its activities to those living at a distance but affected, for example, by nature loss, such as the loss of migratory species, or impact drivers, such as water or air pollution that the organization generates.

of many industrial and agricultural processes.\u00a0Nitrogen and phosphorus are both essential elements for plant growth, so fertiliser production and application are the main concern. Human activities now convert more atmospheric nitrogen\u00a0into reactive forms than all of the Earth\u2019s terrestrial processes combined.\u00a0Much of this new reactive nitrogen is emitted to the atmosphere in various forms rather than taken up by crops.

0":26,"Term":"Biological feed conversion ratio (bFCR) ","Definition":"The biological feed conversion ratio describes the amount of feed required to produce one kilo of farmed fish. The feed conversion ratio is the conventional measure of livestock production efficiency: the weight of feed intake divided by weight gained by the animal or fish. The biological feed conversion ratio is used to define the biological efficiency of the feed (and\/or animal).

0":53,"Term":"Deforestation","Definition":"The conversion of forest to other land use independently of whether human-induced or not. Explanatory notes: 1.\t Includes permanent reduction of the tree canopy cover below the minimum 10% threshold. 2.\t Includes areas of forest converted to agriculture, pasture, water reservoirs, mining and urban areas. 3.\t The term specifically excludes areas where the trees have been removed as a result of harvesting or logging, and where the forest is expected to regenerate naturally or with the aid of silvicultural measures. 4.\t The term also includes areas where, for example, the impact of disturbance, overutilization or changing environmental conditions affects the forest to an extent that it cannot sustain a canopy cover above the 10% threshold. 5.\t The concept of long-term is central to this definition and is defined as ten\u00a0years. 6.\t Note that to determine whether the removal of trees from an area is classed as deforestation, it is necessary to predict the future development of the area. If new forest trees are established in the near future, the land is classified as forest throughout the regeneration period. This regrowth is considered \u2018reforestation\u2019 and the full process \u2018conversion\u2019. If, on the other hand, a sufficient density of trees is not established in the near future, or if land is converted to other land use, the area should be considered deforested.

Accountability Framework). \u2022\t No-deforestation refers to no gross deforestation of natural forests, which the Accountability Framework specifies as the appropriate policy and goal on this topic for companies and supply chains. \u2022\t In the context of the Accountability Framework, deforestation refers to the loss of natural forest (see definition of deforestation). The AFi recognises the High Carbon Stock Approach (HCSA) as a practical tool to implement no-deforestation in the tropics, in contexts where the tool has been validated.* \u2022\t The terms \u2018no-deforestation\u2019 and \u2018deforestation-free\u2019 are used in favour of \u2018zero deforestation\u2019 because \u2018zero\u2019 can imply an absolutist approach that may be at odds with the need sometimes to accommodate minimal levels of conversion at the site level in the interest of facilitating optimal conservation and production outcomes (see definition for minimal level of deforestation or conversion).

(representing services rather than financing) and they can take the form of a flow activity (temporary association with transactions) rather than a stock activity (held on book).

one unit of biomass. The smaller the FCR, the greater is the feed use efficiency. Feed efficiency is simply the inverse of the FCR \u2013 the amount of aquaculture biomass realised per unit of feed input. The larger the FE, the greater the efficiency of feed use. The FCR is more commonly used by fish and shrimp farmers.

patches of lesser total and isolated from each other by a matrix of dissimilar habitats.

0":136,"Term":"Indigenous Peoples","Definition":"There is no formal definition adopted in international law. A strict definition is seen as unnecessary and undesirable. The United Nations use a working definition from the Martinez Cobo Study: \u2018Indigenous communities, peoples and nations are those which, having a historical continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies that developed on their territories, consider themselves distinct from other sectors of the societies now prevailing on those territories, or parts of them. They form at present non-dominant sectors of society and are determined to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral territories, and their ethnic identity, as the basis of their continued existence as peoples, in accordance with their own cultural patterns, social institutions and legal system.\u2019 It also notes that an Indigenous person is: \u2018\u2026 one who belongs to these indigenous populations through self-identification as indigenous (group consciousness) and is recognised and accepted by these populations as one of its members (acceptance by the group). This preserves for these communities the sovereign right and power to decide who belongs to them, without external interference.\u2019 According to ILO Convention 169, Indigenous Peoples are descendants of population \u2018which inhabited a country or geographical region during its conquest or colonization or the establishment of present state boundaries\u2019 and \u2018retain some or all of their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions\u2019.

0":143,"Term":"Invasive alien species","Definition":"Species whose introduction and\/or spread by human action outside their natural distribution threatens biological diversity, food security, and human health and well-being. \u2018Alien\u2019 refers to the species having been introduced outside its natural distribution (\u2018exotic\u2019, \u201cnon-native\u2019 and \u2018nonindigenous\u2019 are synonyms for \u2018alien\u2019). \u2018Invasive\u2019 means tending to expand into and modify ecosystems to which it has been introduced. Thus, a species may be alien without being invasive, or, in the case of a species native to a region, it may increase and become invasive, without actually being an alien species.

0":157,"Term":"Light pollution","Definition":"Light pollution refers to artificial light that alters the natural patterns of light and dark in ecosystems. It comprises direct glare, chronically increased illumination and temporary, unexpected fluctuations in lighting. The sources of ecological light pollution include sky glow, illuminated buildings, streetlights, fishing boats, security lights, lights on vehicles, flares on offshore oil platforms, and lights on undersea research vessels. While light pollution is eminently detrimental to nocturnal and migratory animals and to animals in flight, it also produces harmful effects on plants. Longcore T., Rich, C.

In the absence of any such guidance, the TNFD recommends that organizations apply the ISSB\u2019s approach to identifying information that is material for users of general financial reports as a baseline. Report preparers who want or need to report to a different materiality approach may apply an impact materiality approach to identify information in addition to the ISSB\u2019s baseline. With respect to impact materiality, the TNFD has aligned its recommendations (and supporting additional guidance) with the language and approach of the GRI\u2019s Sustainability Reporting Standards.

0":175,"Term":"Minimum flow","Definition":"A general term used to describe a flow that must be maintained without further reduction over a specified period, either during the dry season or over the entire year. It implies that ecosystem functioning can be protected through the delivery of a minimum and constant flow, whereas evidence shows within- and between-year-flow variability is essential to maintaining healthy rivers.

0":177,"Term":"Mitigation hierarchy (and conservation hierarchy)","Definition":" The mitigation hierarchy is the sequence of actions to anticipate and avoid, and where avoidance is not possible, minimise, and, when impacts occur, restore, and where significant residual impacts remain, offset for biodiversity-related risks and impacts on affected communities and the environment. The conservation hierarchy goes beyond mitigating impacts, to encompass any activities affecting nature. This means that conservation actions to address historical, systemic and non-attributable biodiversity loss can be accounted for in the same framework as actions to mitigate specific impacts. The TNFD aligns to the SBTN AR3T Framework that covers actions to avoid future impacts, reduce current impacts, regenerate and restore ecosystems, and transform the systems in which companies are embedded.

0":193,"Term":"Nature-related physical risks","Definition":"Nature-related physical risks are risks resulting from the degradation of nature (such as changes in ecosystem equilibria, including soil quality and species composition) and consequential loss of ecosystem services that economic activity depends upon. These risks can be chronic (e.g. a gradual decline of species diversity of pollinators resulting in reduced crop yields, or water scarcity) or acute (e.g. natural disasters or forest spills). Nature-related physical risks arise as a result of changes in the biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) conditions that support healthy, functioning ecosystems. These risks are usually location-specific.

0":196,"Term":"Nature-related systemic risks","Definition":" Nature-related systemic risks are risks arising from the breakdown of the entire system, rather than the failure of individual parts. Nature-related systemic risks are characterised by modest tipping points combining indirectly to produce large failures and cascading interactions of physical and transition risks. One loss triggers a chain of others and stops systems from recovering their equilibrium after a shock. Nature-related systemic risk covers more than only risk to a financial system (i.e. financial stability risk) It also covers the risks from the breakdown of natural systems (i.e. ecosystems).

protecting, restoring, and\/or reducing negative impacts on nature. These risks can be prompted, for example, by changes in regulation and policy, legal precedent, technology, or investor sentiment and consumer preferences. They can also arise from activities aimed at restoring nature that no longer align with, for example, revised policies.

0":200,"Term":"Nitrogen planetary boundary","Definition":" Human activities now convert more atmospheric nitrogen into reactive forms than all of the Earth\u2019s terrestrial processes combined. Much of this new reactive nitrogen is emitted to the atmosphere in various forms rather than taken up by crops. When it is rained out, it pollutes waterways and coastal zones or accumulates in the terrestrial biosphere.

nutrient outputs leaving the system (the uptake of nutrients for crop and pasture production).

When assessing the amount of plastic in a packaging component, the additives are classed as part of the plastic. Plastics include polymers which are: \u2022\t biodegradable \u2022\t compostable \u2022\t oxo-degradable If a plastic packaging component is made from multiple materials but contains more plastic by weight (including additives which form part of the plastic) than any other substance, it will be classed as a plastic packaging component.

0":250,"Term":"Regenerative agriculture","Definition":" There is no scientific consensus definition of regenerative agriculture; rather there are process (use of cover crops, reduced tillage, etc.), principle and outcome-based definitions (improved soil health, etc.). As TNFD adopts an outcome-based opportunity definition, based on business activities that deliver nature positive outcomes, a business should as a minimum use a definition of regenerative agriculture that allows it to capture the nature-positive outcomes in terms of improvements to environmental assets and flows in ecosystem services based on producing or sourcing from the regenerative farm practices. The most cited outcomes as part of a definition of regenerative agriculture in scientific literature include improved soil health, increased carbon sequestration and increase in biodiversity.

It provides capacities for turning risks into opportunities. This includes: (1) adaptive capacities to absorb shocks and turbulence and avoid unpleasant tipping points, thresholds, and regime shifts; (2) capacities to prepare for, learn from, and navigate uncertainty and surprise; (3) capacities for keeping options alive and creating space for innovation; and (4) capacities for systemic transformation in the face of crises and unsustainable development pathways and traps.

0":256,"Term":"Restoration","Definition":"The process of assisting the recovery of an area or ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed. The aim of ecological restoration is to re-establish the ecosystem\u2019s composition, structure and function, usually bringing it back to its original (pre-disturbance) state or to a healthy state close to the original. An ecosystem is restored when it contains sufficient biotic and abiotic resources to sustain itself structurally and functionally and can continue its development without further assistance or subsidy. It will demonstrate resilience to normal ranges of environmental stress and disturbance and interact with contiguous ecosystems in terms of biotic and abiotic flows and cultural interactions. (Ecosystem restoration is sometimes used interchangeably with ecological restoration, but ecological restoration always addresses biodiversity conservation and ecological integrity, whereas some approaches to ecosystem restoration may focus solely on the delivery of ecosystem services).

or reused for the same purpose for which it was conceived.

management. Well-applied rewilding can restore ecosystems at a landscape scale, help mitigate climate change, and provide socio-economic opportunities for communities.

0":317,"Term":"Unintentional \/ intentional introduction of invasive alien species","Definition":" Species whose intentional or unintentional introduction and\/or spread by human action outside their natural distribution threatens biological diversity, food security, and human health and well-being. \u2018Alien\u2019 refers to the species having been introduced outside its natural distribution (\u2018exotic\u2019, \u201cnon-native\u2019 and \u2018nonindigenous\u2019 are synonyms for \u2018alien\u2019). \u2018Invasive\u2019 means tending to expand into and modify ecosystems to which it has been introduced. Thus, a species may be alien without being invasive, or, in the case of a species native to a region, it may increase and become invasive, without actually being an alien species.

It may have many types of sources, from imprecision in the data to ambiguously defined concepts or terminology, incomplete understanding of critical processes, or uncertain projections of human behaviour.

It can be approached from two points of view, either in terms of energy or in terms of flows of water, material and nutrients of the city, in terms of the rate of mass flow per unit area (called mass fluxes). These approaches are used to address, for example, the urban sustainability\u00a0indicators. Zhang, Y.

0":345,"Term":"Water column","Definition":"A concept used in oceanography to describe the physical (temperature, salinity, light penetration) and chemical (pH, dissolved oxygen, nutrient salts) characteristics of seawater at different depths for a defined geographical point. The water column extends from the surface to the bottom of the ocean and may reach 11 km in depth (Mariana trench in the Pacific). The physical and chemical characteristics determine the distribution of living organisms in the ocean. At the surface, sunlight provides photosynthesis and the deeper we go, the darker and colder the environment becomes (2\u00b0C at great depths).

0":351,"Term":"Water scarcity","Definition":"Refers to the volumetric abundance, or lack thereof, of freshwater resources. Scarcity is human driven; it is a function of the volume of human water consumption relative to the volume of water resources in a given area. As such, an arid region with very little water, but no human water consumption would not be considered scarce, but rather arid. Water scarcity is a physical, objective reality that can be measured consistently across regions and over time. Water scarcity reflects the physical abundance of freshwater rather than whether that water is suitable for use. For instance, a region may have abundant water resources (and thus not be considered water scarce), but have such severe pollution that those supplies are unfit for human or ecological uses.
