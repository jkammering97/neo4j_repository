So as Annika said,<br>biodiversity is very much about variation and<br>variation in different scales. So when we want to<br>work with biodiversity, we need to work in scales<br>in the landscape in habitats and on species level<br>and do that also throughout the life cycle of the<br>forest. And then as you know, the life cycle of<br>the Nordic forest is somewhere between 70 and 100<br>years. In the '90s, also as Annika mentioned,<br>there was a radical change in how we do<br>sustainable forest management and this we now see<br>solid track records on the development of<br>biodiversity as a consequence of that. But we also<br>want now to increase our activities to be more<br>active and also developed by the biodiversity<br>management, not just to restore it. We foster this<br>with collaboration with universities, NGOs and<br>other stakeholders in society and, of course,<br>driven by all our people out in the forest<br>skilled, skilled people would love to be in the<br>forest and have a big heart for nature and<br>biodiversity as such.

We<br>cut the trees of 3, 4-meter high and leave a stand<br>that can gradually die and be a good place for<br>insects and birds later on. Retention trees is<br>another area where you keep valuable trees or you<br>keep a group of trees to get shadow into the<br>forest and for example, mosses that Annika talked<br>about need to have more moister conditions in the<br>forest.

We'll see how Séché<br>Environnement has been a key player in sustainable<br>development and how climate change is part of our<br>concerns. I will use 2 key areas recovering<br>materials. And for example, I'll use solvent<br>regeneration which enables our customers to have a<br>product arising from waste, which will take us<br>away from the use of fossil energy in order to<br>combat -- to counter climate change. And the other<br>challenge is energy recovery, which enables our<br>customers to use energy that will be used in --<br>substituted for fossil energy without CO2<br>emissions. So these are examples of countering<br>climate change. And we do all this by preserving<br>biodiversity with a 4-year plan with the<br>initiative -- the Act4nature initiative, which<br>concerns approximately 20 of our sites to preserve<br>biodiversity. Séché Environnement is, by<br>definition, depolluting the environment. And if we<br>want to save the planet, we have to manage all the<br>impact. I've covered different areas, the<br>preservation of natural resources. By preserving<br>materials, countering climate change through --<br>and also preserving biodiversity and depolluting,<br>combating polluting that we have to, therefore,<br>act in these 4 areas and create synergies in order<br>to preserve the environment.

And as long<br>as they are responsibly managed, perhaps, these<br>objectives can come together and bring added value<br>to the landscape itself. So responsible forest<br>management is about what? It's about respecting<br>and harmonizing values, and we're talking about<br>environmental, social and economic values, the 3<br>pillars that underpin the big term sustainability.<br>But we also want to conciliate yields with<br>responsibility.",

And that's where we've been innovating<br>more in Forests Forward to say, \"Okay, how can we<br>get really specific investments into forested<br>landscapes to ensure that we have a mixture of<br>forests in a good landscape, but we're looking at<br>different issues related to climate<br>[indiscernible] biodiversity.\" We're thinking<br>about the role that different people play in<br>decisions made in the landscape in land<br>management, planning and use.

In light of this new global standard,<br>do you consider that the integrity of Westpac's<br>net 0 commitment could be called into question<br>unless the bank undertakes due diligence to ensure<br>that it will not finance deforestation? And what<br>work has been done to assess the bank's exposure<br>to nature related risks, including deforestation,<br>within our lending portfolio?",

I won't reiterate the points about the<br>UN High-Level Expert Group commitment last week or<br>UN Secretary General comments in relation to which<br>to be aware of, but they did also point to the<br>fact that for financial institutions to have<br>credible net zero commitments for them to be<br>accepted to avoid regulatory risk around them.<br>The financial institutions also should avoid<br>finance or credit to deforestation phase that out<br>by 2025.

Credit<br>assets earn a spread over risk-free, and this<br>excess return can be compared with a marginal risk<br>capital that we can assess through our Internal<br>Model. Taking the excess return and comparing it<br>with the marginal risk capital requirement allows<br>us to determine what our marginal return on<br>capital is, and that is a key metric for us in<br>determining our actions on the book.

My<br>question is around nature related risk, and it's<br>been brought up before and perhaps you could tie<br>into your answers. Some answers to what was raised<br>previously. I won't reiterate the points about the<br>UN High-Level Expert Group commitment last week or<br>UN Secretary General comments in relation to which<br>to be aware of, but they did also point to the<br>fact that for financial institutions to have<br>credible net zero commitments for them to be<br>accepted to avoid regulatory risk around them.<br>The financial institutions also should avoid<br>finance or credit to deforestation phase that out<br>by 2025. Australia is now a global deforestation<br>hotspot, one of the only world the only<br>development country in the world that is over<br>680,000 -- 630,000 hectares of land cleared in<br>2018, '19 in Queensland alone, mostly for pass-<br>through expansion.  So in light of this global<br>standard, does the bank that perceive there's a<br>potential risk to its reputation or regulatory<br>risk if it doesn't cease lending.  And in relation<br>to this, how the bank conducted an assessment of<br>its dependencies and impacts on nature. And if so,<br>when is that likely to be released from a<br>continuous disclosure point of view?",

I won't reiterate the points about the<br>UN High-Level Expert Group commitment last week or<br>UN Secretary General comments in relation to which<br>to be aware of, but they did also point to the<br>fact that for financial institutions to have<br>credible net zero commitments for them to be<br>accepted to avoid regulatory risk around them.<br>The financial institutions also should avoid<br>finance or credit to deforestation phase that out<br>by 2025.

And each time there is a very large loss, it<br>surprises people, it shocks people. There are big<br>headlines. So there's also, if you want, what we<br>call headline risk involved here. So our models<br>obviously are completely unimpacted by this. Our<br>experts try to look through all these emotions and<br>really look at what actually is happening behind.<br>And there, we can say also in secondary perils.<br>Actually, the largest movements have not been on<br>the exposure side. So climate change does have<br>more of an impact on secondary perils than it has<br>on some of the main perils, but that has not been<br>the main driver for the increase in losses we have<br>seen. So generally, the increase in losses are<br>coming from more of the values that are actually<br>moving to those exposed areas. So more people<br>moving to areas that are, for example, exposed to<br>secondary perils that are, obviously, we see<br>growing values in those areas. And then when<br>climate change moves actually the perils upwards,<br>it's a little bit like a tidal wave at the moment<br>it arrives. And at that point in time, surprises<br>everyone. Also a little bit of our models, but we<br>can adjust for that actually quite quickly."

As for most people, most intuitive impacts<br>would be on wind and flood risk. You see flood<br>risk is not within the top 10. So in a sense,<br>those impacts may have -- that come from climate<br>change may have a lower impact on the overall<br>Hannover Re book. These are -- there's a lot of<br>earthquake scenarios here in this chart. But of<br>course, we have a number of tropical cyclone<br>perils here, which could be affected by climate<br>change risk as well. So those scenarios have a<br>particular attention when we discuss both models,<br>impact of climate change on models and also on<br>business.Also, I mean, just to set the theme here.<br>I guess we are all aware that there is a<br>protection gap. These are different figures that<br>we have taken from a model loss -- from a vendor's<br>statistics on modeled losses, say, on the average.<br>And if you look at a 100-year event, the<br>protection gap is still more pronounced as of<br>today, and it has sort of basically not come down<br>over the past years.So there is still substantial<br>protection gap in natural catastrophes as of<br>today, with the ongoing climate change, although<br>if we look at regions, there's a difference. Of<br>course, there's a larger protection gap in Asia on<br>developing markets, one could say, than in<br>developed markets. But also for developed markets,<br>it's still substantial. So it's not -- we know<br>that also from the U.S., from U.S."

Our 2 top scenarios, as you know, are<br>U.S. tropical cyclone and U.S. earthquake. I'm<br>showing this slide for 2 reasons. In the context<br>of sort of diversification, it shows that we are<br>sort of also diversifying within our NatCat book.<br>We have quite a number of risks also if we extend<br>beyond the top 10 that are in the range of net EUR<br>500 million to EUR 600 million. So that's a quite<br>broad basis for receiving premium from different<br>perils, which are hopefully not strongly<br>correlated to each other and cause for<br>diversification.We have steered this<br>diversification also in this year's planning<br>process in the sense that the growth for these<br>peak scenarios was like more restrictive than the<br>growth for all the other scenarios. So like<br>underwriters came -- on the P&C side came with<br>very ambitious plans, how they want to grow their<br>portfolios, and we cut that down for the peak<br>scenarios a bit further than we did it for sort of<br>scenarios outside this top 10 list or outside the,<br>say, top 2 peak scenarios here.And the other thing<br>-- the other reason why, I'm just drawing here in<br>the context of climate change risk."

As I mentioned earlier, we've also<br>taken a new commitment recently namely 0 net<br>deforestation for any new project on any new site.<br>We are also part of the task force on nature-<br>related financial disclosures, which kind of<br>mirrors TCFD for matters that pertain to nature.<br>In 2021, 8 biodiversity action plans have been<br>initiated or implemented in connection with new<br>projects. The most visible and publicized action<br>plan is shown to the right of the chart, and it<br>relates to our Tilenga project in Uganda. As you<br>know, it's tailored to generate a net gain for<br>biodiversity. Second area of focus, preserving<br>scarce freshwater resources. Early this year, we<br>joined the UN Compact CEO Water Mandate."

And it's very likely that your loans, both<br>to businesses and to households, reflect that sort<br>of national average. Last year, there was<br>published a very highly credible paper by<br>ecological scientists that found that 18 of the 19<br>Australian ecosystems that they examined in detail<br>are at serious risk of collapse. These include<br>iconic and essential ecosystems for human health<br>and wellbeing such as the Murray-Darling Basin and<br>the Great Barrier Reef, but they're all over<br>Australia, these vulnerable ecological systems.<br>Now of course, the floods in the [indiscernible]<br>are going to reverse that for a while, but they<br>have their own impact on your customers, both<br>households and businesses. So my question -- I've<br>got 3 short questions. Does the ANZ conduct<br>assessments, of the extent to which each loan it<br>makes is at risk from the effects of substantial<br>decline or collapse of a relevant ecosystem? First<br>of all, you have to know what they are. And then<br>secondly, when does the bank plan to start<br>reporting on the extent and character of the<br>nature-based risks that its portfolio of loans and<br>investments faces?"

Just to give<br>a few numbers. 2019 alone, our P&C Reinsurance<br>business paid out claims over USD 11 billion and<br>$2 billion of these claims were related to natural<br>catastrophe losses, helping many families and<br>businesses to recover after adverse events. To<br>provide coverage for natural catastrophe risk, we<br>obviously need to have deep risk knowledge around<br>these risks. Since decades, we have invested in<br>research and development to be on top of these<br>risks and develop our own proprietary risk models<br>around natural catastrophe and also climate<br>change."

           "n climate change, 2019, as you know, was the<br>second warmest year on record. So there's a real<br>sense of urgency that we have also in our report,<br>on our sigma analysis that we need to take climate<br>action. We need to take climate action now<br>worldwide in all sectors for the benefit of<br>society and also to build further economic<br>resilience. On the economic development, as we<br>show in the sigma report, the human activities,<br>both GDP and urbanization, are key drivers for the<br>rising insured losses while climate change is an<br>amplifier. And what is really needed is also the<br>industry needing to tackle how the extreme weather<br>risk is changing to have a really comprehensive<br>analysis. Let's dig a little bit deeper on the<br>next slide. And this is -- as an economist, on<br>Slide 4, this is really my favorite chart in the<br>sigma graph. What you see here in the graph on the<br>left-hand side, you see the global economic losses<br>for nat cat. These are economic losses, not<br>insured losses, so the economic losses from 1918<br>-- 1980, excuse me, til 2018. The gray line is the<br>simulation with historical global nat cat data for<br>the physical damage to show the economic losses if<br>countries have today's GDP level. So not the GDP<br>level at point of time in the past but today's GDP<br>level, to really normalize the data and to see<br>actually how does economic development and<br>urbanization impact the data."

           "That's not mentioned anywhere. It's rather climate<br>change make some of these effects much more likely<br>to happen. And when it comes to wildfire, it<br>becomes more tangible. When it comes to hurricanes<br>or typhoons, these big storm events, climate<br>change is still masked where the urban impact<br>often is more important -- or it's the<br>urbanization impact of human development is a more<br>important factor changing this risk landscape. But<br>what all these 3 events serve for us as an<br>industry is to make a point. It's not a static<br>risk landscape. It's a dynamic picture. Year-on-<br>year, this changes. Urban sprawl, as Jerome was<br>mentioning, one city of the size of New York<br>coming in addition, that means something on that<br>risk landscape on top of climate change. And<br>that's the big learning we're also discussing<br>through the whole sigma study, that these dynamics<br>have various factors. And in terms -- and if we<br>move on to the next slide, Alexa. Quite a symbolic<br>slide that us, in general, as human beings, but<br>also the insurance industry, the typical way<br>looking at these risks from natural perils and<br>disasters, looking backward, taking an average of<br>a longer-term historical observation period is<br>done here with temperature regimes on this slide.<br>And it's quite obvious.

We don't see ourselves from a<br>climate change perspective having reached the<br>tipping point. So changes are not dramatic from<br>one year to the next year. There are changes, but<br>not dramatic kind of endangering the<br>sustainability of the insurance business model. As<br>long as we can follow that trend, but we have to<br>actively. Insurability is not at risk. Clearly,<br>there's some areas in the world that's<br>particularly close to sea -- to the sea coasts<br>where sea level rise, which is the most tangible<br>hazard factor, we'll make some of these areas<br>uninhabitable unless human beings are taking some<br>precautionary measures. There's a discussion in<br>the same study about what The Netherlands has been<br>doing over the last not decades but even<br>centuries, in protecting them from the sea, but<br>now also from the increasing sea level. So for the<br>insurance industry, it's important to not partner<br>but be in lockstep with what humanity is also<br>doing beyond just financial risk transfer to<br>protect the most exposed areas.

Our<br>experts try to look through all these emotions and<br>really look at what actually is happening behind.<br>And there, we can say also in secondary perils.<br>Actually, the largest movements have not been on<br>the exposure side.

As for most people, most intuitive impacts<br>would be on wind and flood risk. You see flood<br>risk is not within the top 10. So in a sense,<br>those impacts may have -- that come from climate<br>change may have a lower impact on the overall<br>Hannover Re book. These are -- there's a lot of<br>earthquake scenarios here in this chart. But of<br>course, we have a number of tropical cyclone<br>perils here, which could be affected by climate<br>change risk as well. So those scenarios have a<br>particular attention when we discuss both models,<br>impact of climate change on models and also on<br>business.Also, I mean, just to set the theme here.<br>I guess we are all aware that there is a<br>protection gap. These are different figures that<br>we have taken from a model loss -- from a vendor's<br>statistics on modeled losses, say, on the average.<br>And if you look at a 100-year event, the<br>protection gap is still more pronounced as of<br>today, and it has sort of basically not come down<br>over the past years.So there is still substantial<br>protection gap in natural catastrophes as of<br>today, with the ongoing climate change, although<br>if we look at regions, there's a difference. Of<br>course, there's a larger protection gap in Asia on<br>developing markets, one could say, than in<br>developed markets. But also for developed markets,<br>it's still substantial. So it's not -- we know<br>that also from the U.S., from U.S."

We'll see how Séché<br>Environnement has been a key player in sustainable<br>development and how climate change is part of our<br>concerns. I will use 2 key areas recovering<br>materials. And for example, I'll use solvent<br>regeneration which enables our customers to have a<br>product arising from waste, which will take us<br>away from the use of fossil energy in order to<br>combat -- to counter climate change. And the other<br>challenge is energy recovery, which enables our<br>customers to use energy that will be used in --<br>substituted for fossil energy without CO2<br>emissions. So these are examples of countering<br>climate change. And we do all this by preserving<br>biodiversity with a 4-year plan with the<br>initiative -- the Act4nature initiative, which<br>concerns approximately 20 of our sites to preserve<br>biodiversity. Séché Environnement is, by<br>definition, depolluting the environment. And if we<br>want to save the planet, we have to manage all the<br>impact. I've covered different areas, the<br>preservation of natural resources. By preserving<br>materials, countering climate change through --<br>and also preserving biodiversity and depolluting,<br>combating polluting that we have to, therefore,<br>act in these 4 areas and create synergies in order<br>to preserve the environment.

I won't reiterate the points about the<br>UN High-Level Expert Group commitment last week or<br>UN Secretary General comments in relation to which<br>to be aware of, but they did also point to the<br>fact that for financial institutions to have<br>credible net zero commitments for them to be<br>accepted to avoid regulatory risk around them.<br>The financial institutions also should avoid<br>finance or credit to deforestation phase that out<br>by 2025.

And what are working forests?<br>It's the type of forests that I have been<br>describing. Forests that are managed both for<br>production and conservation purposes, and also for<br>bioeconomy. Bioeconomy is more and more a need for<br>the society, a need for the future we're trying to<br>build, moving away from fossil fuel -- from<br>fossil-based materials. So working forests and<br>bioeconomy are really the 2 main pillars to<br>provide a positive impact and a maximum<br>contribution for the sustainable development<br>goals. But that goes around also with impacting<br>people in procurement, in climate, in water<br>circularity and communities. And what does this<br>mean in practice? Well, I'll take you on a deep<br>dive also based on what we do. So as you know,<br>forests are made of trees. And trees and other<br>plants have this extraordinary capacity of<br>sequestrating carbon dioxide, and this means that<br>they are also helping fight climate change.

Yes, I will be navigating you<br>through this challenge, which is to try and<br>discover the links between forests, biodiversity<br>and sustainability.

Sustainability<br>is on the agenda of companies, of people,<br>individuals and the society as a whole. But do we<br>really know the interconnections and how deep this<br>goes. And what is the relation? Why are we talking<br>about this when we're talking about paper, about<br>discovery? So I'll try and give you some hints.So<br>-- well, landscapes, as you know, landscapes are<br>home for several types of forests and several<br>types of land users. So in the same landscape<br>level, we can have production planted forests as<br>well as multiple used forest spaces, but also we<br>can have patches of zones with interest for<br>conservation and they may all inhabit the same<br>landscape and be managed together with different<br>objectives -- management objectives. And as long<br>as they are responsibly managed, perhaps, these<br>objectives can come together and bring added value<br>to the landscape itself. So responsible forest<br>management is about what? It's about respecting<br>and harmonizing values, and we're talking about<br>environmental, social and economic values, the 3<br>pillars that underpin the big term sustainability.<br>But we also want to conciliate yields with<br>responsibility."

And that's where we've been innovating<br>more in Forests Forward to say, \"Okay, how can we<br>get really specific investments into forested<br>landscapes to ensure that we have a mixture of<br>forests in a good landscape, but we're looking at<br>different issues related to climate<br>[indiscernible] biodiversity.\" We're thinking<br>about the role that different people play in<br>decisions made in the landscape in land<br>management, planning and use.

You<br>have publicly owned land in different countries<br>according to their own national policies and<br>regulations. You have community or indigenous<br>people owned lands as well.

Hansen assessed how the company<br>is either dependent on or has a negative impact on<br>biodiversity? A new tax policy was also released<br>during the year. I noticed the promise to country-<br>by-country reporting after an analysis of possible<br>issues for the company. I'm pleased with that<br>decision. In conclusion, I would like to<br>congratulate the management and employees on the<br>result for 2020/'21. Thank you for your attention."

And of course, for us, this<br>is pretty much the biomass story, making sure that<br>we buy the right sort of biomass. The intellectual<br>case for biomass as part of the decarbonization of<br>the global economy is well made. I've listed some<br>on this slide. But what's interesting, the<br>politicians, the senior influencers who say<br>biomass is a good thing. They've all got into the<br>habit of saying, but as long as it's the right<br>biomass, the right biomass. And so that's what<br>we've got to do. We've started ever since we<br>burned the first pellet all those years ago, we've<br>been chasing the right biomass but this debate is<br>becoming more sophisticated and the systems we<br>need to put in place to prove that our biomass is<br>right are growing.  So let me just explain what<br>we're doing on that. Firstly, our biomass starts<br>with wood. Wood is an essential part of modern<br>society. wood is part of the solution to<br>sustainable construction et cetera. So imagine a<br>world without wood would be unsustainable. The<br>biomass we buy is linked to the lumber and timber<br>industry. There aren't vast rows of forest just<br>been growing for biomass they're being been grown<br>for the timber industry."

And for example, I'll use solvent<br>regeneration which enables our customers to have a<br>product arising from waste, which will take us<br>away from the use of fossil energy in order to<br>combat -- to counter climate change. And the other<br>challenge is energy recovery, which enables our<br>customers to use energy that will be used in --<br>substituted for fossil energy without CO2<br>emissions. So these are examples of countering<br>climate change. And we do all this by preserving<br>biodiversity with a 4-year plan with the<br>initiative -- the Act4nature initiative, which<br>concerns approximately 20 of our sites to preserve<br>biodiversity. Séché Environnement is, by<br>definition, depolluting the environment. And if we<br>want to save the planet, we have to manage all the<br>impact. I've covered different areas, the<br>preservation of natural resources. By preserving<br>materials, countering climate change through --<br>and also preserving biodiversity and depolluting,<br>combating polluting that we have to, therefore,<br>act in these 4 areas and create synergies in order<br>to preserve the environment.

Yes, I will be navigating you<br>through this challenge, which is to try and<br>discover the links between forests, biodiversity<br>and sustainability.

And what is the relation? Why are we talking<br>about this when we're talking about paper, about<br>discovery? So I'll try and give you some hints.So<br>-- well, landscapes, as you know, landscapes are<br>home for several types of forests and several<br>types of land users. So in the same landscape<br>level, we can have production planted forests as<br>well as multiple used forest spaces, but also we<br>can have patches of zones with interest for<br>conservation and they may all inhabit the same<br>landscape and be managed together with different<br>objectives -- management objectives. And as long<br>as they are responsibly managed, perhaps, these<br>objectives can come together and bring added value<br>to the landscape itself. So responsible forest<br>management is about what? It's about respecting<br>and harmonizing values, and we're talking about<br>environmental, social and economic values, the 3<br>pillars that underpin the big term sustainability.<br>But we also want to conciliate yields with<br>responsibility."

More<br>recently, we've also established an important<br>partnership with Pantera, the only wildlife<br>organization devoted exclusively to the<br>conservation of the wildlife species and their<br>ecosystem. Together, we will work to develop<br>wildlife conservation and management projects in<br>regions where we operate. Our collective goal will<br>be to monitor key wide life populations while<br>taking steps to ensure the security and management<br>of protected areas and habitats for various<br>species of big cats."

I am by education a<br>Forester, and I have spent most of my career in<br>forest management and daily forest operations in<br>Stora Enso in different parts of the world. And I<br>would like to share a little with you today how we<br>now will work with continue to develop our<br>biodiversity activities in the forest. So if I --<br>get the next slide, please. So as Annika said,<br>biodiversity is very much about variation and<br>variation in different scales. So when we want to<br>work with biodiversity, we need to work in scales<br>in the landscape in habitats and on species level<br>and do that also throughout the life cycle of the<br>forest. And then as you know, the life cycle of<br>the Nordic forest is somewhere between 70 and 100<br>years. In the '90s, also as Annika mentioned,<br>there was a radical change in how we do<br>sustainable forest management and this we now see<br>solid track records on the development of<br>biodiversity as a consequence of that. But we also<br>want now to increase our activities to be more<br>active and also developed by the biodiversity<br>management, not just to restore it. We foster this<br>with collaboration with universities, NGOs and<br>other stakeholders in society and, of course,<br>driven by all our people out in the forest<br>skilled, skilled people would love to be in the<br>forest and have a big heart for nature and<br>biodiversity as such.

That's a great question and<br>takes us right back to the framework itself, our<br>sustainability strategic framework, which,<br>obviously, biodiversity is a key component of in<br>terms of our drivers around creating a healthy<br>planet, healthy people. Biodiversity is a really<br>integral part of our delivery of sustainability<br>through the built environment. And what's really<br>interesting is that over the last few years, we've<br>seen a really big upswing in terms of the need and<br>the demand and the drive to drive increased<br>biodiversity in urban areas, particularly off the<br>back of the strength of our urban regeneration<br>pipeline. We're looking at ways of bringing back<br>biodiversity into these urban areas and projects<br>like TRX in Malaysia. We're excited about the<br>brand-new sort of park area and natural<br>environment elements that we'll be bringing into<br>that project. We've had some great opportunities<br>in Chicago with our Southbank project there to<br>bring back a new sort of foreshore area complete<br>with local and native planting. We've got beehives<br>popping up all over the place, whether they're<br>rooftop gardens, et cetera; and even, too, the<br>work that we've been doing in terms of the<br>research here in Sydney with the impact of<br>planting around the efficiency of solar panels and<br>being able to work to sort of drive research that<br>has proven that to plant in and around solar<br>panels actually increases the efficiency and<br>effectiveness of the power generation there."

Decaying wood, different types of deadwood<br>and to promote that, we can create high stands. We<br>cut the trees of 3, 4-meter high and leave a stand<br>that can gradually die and be a good place for<br>insects and birds later on. Retention trees is<br>another area where you keep valuable trees or you<br>keep a group of trees to get shadow into the<br>forest and for example, mosses that Annika talked<br>about need to have more moister conditions in the<br>forest. That's good for them. Some areas should<br>not be touched at all even if they are small<br>areas, they are not reserves, but they are smaller<br>that we keep untouched to promote that type of<br>habitat. And then soil and water, very important<br>to protect the waters from damages and to clean<br>streams, sometimes the faces can move better and<br>more undisturbed and the same. So not destroying<br>the soil as such which tracks and often machines<br>and towards the water steam fields have barriers,<br>buffers also different type of kinds.

And what we many times have talked<br>about on what has been a focus in setting aside<br>areas, protect areas that they should not be<br>managed at all. And this is, of course, a powerful<br>tool, but it's not the only tool and we now want<br>to widen the activities and combined this with<br>much more active management of biodiversity. And<br>that is, of course, then can be done in satisfied<br>areas, but it mainly also occurs in the forest<br>where we produce wood for commercial reasons and<br>keep track on our operations so that the quality<br>of operations do not harm biodiversity is one key<br>area and especially then adding biodiversity<br>management activities that promote, enhance the<br>different features that we want to have on<br>landscape level, on habitat level and for the<br>species to live in this. So let's go to next<br>slide. And Annika talked about forest fires, that<br>is, of course, 1 element and that is a large scale<br>element and it's a bit risky.

And what we do with the<br>farmers is we [indiscernible] wildflower margins.<br>So they give over some of the edges, [ like beyond<br>] hedgerows, to wildflowers. And the reason they<br>do that is that it creates a great environment for<br>bees and butterflies. That actually helps to<br>increase the pollination of their crops.

They're looking to be -- to have<br>more -- access to more space. So I think it's part<br>of our strategy to meet what is emerging<br>regulation, really, but to try and use it as<br>alongside the branding that we've got for the<br>Heritage product. In term you mentioned costs, I<br>think achieving net biodiversity gain does vary<br>quite a lot from site to site.

And the other<br>challenge is energy recovery, which enables our<br>customers to use energy that will be used in --<br>substituted for fossil energy without CO2<br>emissions. So these are examples of countering<br>climate change. And we do all this by preserving<br>biodiversity with a 4-year plan with the<br>initiative -- the Act4nature initiative, which<br>concerns approximately 20 of our sites to preserve<br>biodiversity. Séché Environnement is, by<br>definition, depolluting the environment. And if we<br>want to save the planet, we have to manage all the<br>impact. I've covered different areas, the<br>preservation of natural resources. By preserving<br>materials, countering climate change through --<br>and also preserving biodiversity and depolluting,<br>combating polluting that we have to, therefore,<br>act in these 4 areas and create synergies in order<br>to preserve the environment.

And only this<br>will grant to a -- stock-listed company -- to a<br>company like us to every company the ability to do<br>so, but it is something where we are deciding to<br>do so where we are dedicated to and this mission,<br>vision and the sustainability strategy governs our<br>activities.So this brings me to the end of my<br>introductory remarks. I would like to ask Burkhard<br>Lohr to present his part, and then we are willing<br>to take your questions and try to give you the<br>proper answer. Thank you very much for the time<br>being."

Yes, I will be navigating you<br>through this challenge, which is to try and<br>discover the links between forests, biodiversity<br>and sustainability. So how do these interconnect?<br>Well, shall we discover the answer? Of course,<br>forests and biodiversity seem easy. Sustainability<br>is on the agenda of companies, of people,<br>individuals and the society as a whole. But do we<br>really know the interconnections and how deep this<br>goes. And what is the relation? Why are we talking<br>about this when we're talking about paper, about<br>discovery? So I'll try and give you some hints.So<br>-- well, landscapes, as you know, landscapes are<br>home for several types of forests and several<br>types of land users. So in the same landscape<br>level, we can have production planted forests as<br>well as multiple used forest spaces, but also we<br>can have patches of zones with interest for<br>conservation and they may all inhabit the same<br>landscape and be managed together with different<br>objectives -- management objectives. And as long<br>as they are responsibly managed, perhaps, these<br>objectives can come together and bring added value<br>to the landscape itself. So responsible forest<br>management is about what? It's about respecting<br>and harmonizing values, and we're talking about<br>environmental, social and economic values, the 3<br>pillars that underpin the big term sustainability.<br>But we also want to conciliate yields with<br>responsibility."

So what we want when<br>we're managing forests is to have a no net loss of<br>biodiversity, but as much as possible a net<br>positive gain, so in reaching the area in<br>biodiversity. And how do we do it at The Navigator<br>Company? This is just an example. So we manage<br>more than 107,000 hectares. But not everything is<br>production forests. It's about 75%. All this area<br>is certified both by FSC and PEFC, but we also<br>preserve habitats. We do monitoring of fauna and<br>flora. We have encountered 46 different Natura<br>2000 habitats that we have met and that we<br>protect. We display connectivity features in the<br>field so that this biodiversity is able to<br>complete their functions. And of course, we do<br>several initiatives for forest protection so that<br>we can ensure health and vitality of the forest as<br>a whole. This is what about -- this is what<br>responsible forest management is about, I'm sorry.<br>So this is how we do it. And -- well, how can we<br>relate this with sustainability? Well, the WBCSD<br>has issued the Forest Sector SDG Roadmap, which is<br>a reference document for the companies in the<br>forest sector to maximize their contribution for<br>the sustainable development goals of the United<br>Nations. And looking at the forest products value<br>chain as a whole, now passing from the forest to<br>the products, we can see that across the whole<br>value chain, there are opportunities for positive<br>impact."

The<br>VBDO stands for Dutch Association of Investors for<br>Sustainable Development. And it has been a couple<br>of years now that we've been engaging with Wolters<br>Kluwer this way, and that we're happy to continue<br>that engagement this year as well. And the 3<br>topics we would like to discuss today refer to,<br>number one, is biodiversity; number two is the<br>labor conditions in the value chain; and number<br>three is diversity and inclusion. I hear you<br>thinking about like biodiversity and Wolters<br>Kluwer, could it ever be material? So let me<br>explain why we would like to put this on the<br>agenda this theme. The World Economic Forum has<br>identified in its risk report in 2020 by diversity<br>as one of the top 3 highest risks for companies<br>and for humanity in total. So it is interesting to<br>at least be aware of that risk and to really look<br>into what does it mean for us. Another topic in<br>that area that has recently increased the<br>attention to biodiversity and the value of<br>biodiversity is the EU taxonomy. Also in that<br>taxonomy, there is a lot of attention to<br>biodiversity and its value, its importance. So<br>yes, the reason why we would like to put this on<br>the agenda in the engagement with Wolters Kluwer<br>is that it's an important topic, and it may become<br>a more important topic even than climate change.<br>So let's have a look into that."

You<br>could also look into what we think is the<br>potential impact of Wolters Kluwer as an<br>information provider. There might be a really<br>serious business opportunity for Wolters Kluwer to<br>play a role in disseminating, developing<br>information, support tools in the coming years for<br>all those professionals that need that specific<br>information and support in this respect of<br>biodiversity. So that's the question. Do you see<br>as Wolters Kluwer a role for yourself to play in<br>this increasingly important topic on biodiversity?<br>So that's referring to SDG 14 and 15, just as a<br>reminder.

We have<br>defined 5 steps. So the first one is to identify<br>the zones that are at risk, starting with our own<br>footprint, our own site.

The third step then would be to define the<br>action plans to prevent, manage and eventually<br>remediate some of these risks. Step 4 in the way<br>we've aligned it in our plan is then to monitor,<br>but also report on the implementation of the<br>action plans. And step 5 would be then to extend<br>that first exercise, which is at the level of<br>Signify, as you have said to the whole ecosystem<br>that we're managing, so our supply chain on one<br>hand, but also our customers in the use phase.<br>So, so far, we have completed step 1. And we can<br>say that none of our sites are in a risk area. But<br>there is 1 site which is in a key biodiversity<br>area. So now we need to conduct the other steps.<br>Step 2 and step 3, we believe that we should be<br>able to do that before the end of 2023. And by the<br>end of 2025, we should be done with the 5 steps,<br>including also the external part, which is the use<br>phase and our supply chain."

So I have both<br>perspectives from theory and practice on this<br>topic of biodiversity. And in my talk here today,<br>I will first provide a brief line on the subject<br>of biodiversity, putting it a bit in a global<br>context. And then I will take you from there to<br>the Nordic forest. Next slide, please. So<br>biodiversity, it's all about the variability of<br>different biological life forms here on earth. And<br>normally, we talk about biodiversity on 3<br>different levels: on genetic level, on species<br>level and an ecosystem level. And biodiversity has<br>been regulated internationally since 1992 in the<br>UN Convention of Biological Diversity. And the<br>goals of this convention is really to promote<br>biodiversity conservation. It is to ensure<br>sustainable use of this important resource and<br>it's also about fair sharing of the benefits that<br>may arise out of the use of genetic resources.Next<br>slide. So biodiversity is a rather complex topic,<br>I would say. But when we talk about it, daily like<br>we do in media nowadays nearly. Then I think it's<br>mainly 2 arguments that are important to make<br>biodiversity relevant for the public. And the<br>first 1 is about functionality. It's about<br>biodiversities needed to maintain proper ecosystem<br>function."

But why do we talk so much<br>about biodiversity at this point in time, I think<br>1 important process. I think there's many answers<br>to that question, but I would like to mention 1<br>process, and that is the IPBES process. IPBES is<br>for biodiversity what IPCC is for climate change,<br>I would say. It's about gathering scientists from<br>all over the world to sit down and assess the<br>scientific evidence and come with prescriptions or<br>suggestions for pathways forward to policymakers<br>and to other decision makers. Next slide. But<br>going now from the global to the Nordic forest. I<br>would like to mention first about the red list.<br>The red list is an important tool for the<br>practical biodiversity work that we do. And red<br>list, they are issued country-wise. It's really<br>about the risk of species to become extinct within<br>the specific country. And I will use Sweden as an<br>example. And in Sweden, the latest version of the<br>red list was issued in 2020. And the red lists are<br>also, I should mention, they are according to a<br>system set by the International Union for the<br>consolidation of Nature."

Decaying wood, different types of deadwood<br>and to promote that, we can create high stands. We<br>cut the trees of 3, 4-meter high and leave a stand<br>that can gradually die and be a good place for<br>insects and birds later on. Retention trees is<br>another area where you keep valuable trees or you<br>keep a group of trees to get shadow into the<br>forest and for example, mosses that Annika talked<br>about need to have more moister conditions in the<br>forest. That's good for them. Some areas should<br>not be touched at all even if they are small<br>areas, they are not reserves, but they are smaller<br>that we keep untouched to promote that type of<br>habitat. And then soil and water, very important<br>to protect the waters from damages and to clean<br>streams, sometimes the faces can move better and<br>more undisturbed and the same. So not destroying<br>the soil as such which tracks and often machines<br>and towards the water steam fields have barriers,<br>buffers also different type of kinds.

So when we want to<br>work with biodiversity, we need to work in scales<br>in the landscape in habitats and on species level<br>and do that also throughout the life cycle of the<br>forest. And then as you know, the life cycle of<br>the Nordic forest is somewhere between 70 and 100<br>years. In the '90s, also as Annika mentioned,<br>there was a radical change in how we do<br>sustainable forest management and this we now see<br>solid track records on the development of<br>biodiversity as a consequence of that.

So it's not<br>just like creating deadwood would solve the<br>problem like this. It's about having the wood<br>slowly decomposing to make all these different<br>structures and habitats that are important for<br>different species. Another feature, very important<br>in the Nordic Forest is the water and water,<br>naturally flowing water in these landscapes, they<br>create moisture gradients and fertility gradients<br>that also contributes to this variation that we<br>need to enhance biodiversity. Next slide. But it's<br>not only natural processes that creates<br>biodiversity, we can also help nature to create<br>biodiversity. And here, I show 2 examples. One is<br>about fire because we are nowadays very good at<br>preventing fires to occur in the forest. We have<br>not so many and not so large fires. And that is a<br>problem for species that are totally dependent on<br>fires. And we have different vascular plants that<br>need fires for the seeds to grow. And we also have<br>insects that are dependent on deadwood from fire<br>to be able to complete their life cycles. So what<br>we do in forest today is controlled burnings, to<br>enhance the sort of structures and habitats that<br>these species require. Another thing that was<br>perhaps -- or it was very common like 120 years<br>ago or 100 years ago in the Nordic landscape."

Another thing<br>that was perhaps -- or it was very common like 120<br>years ago or 100 years ago in the Nordic<br>landscape. That was cattle grazing in the forest,<br>and cattle create small-scale disturbance that<br>supports different species like particularly<br>vascular plants like orchids, they need this kind<br>of small-scale disturbance to be able to thrive in<br>the forest. Next slide. Before leaving the part to<br>Johan, I would like to mention something about the<br>legacy of previous forest management, that is<br>impacting the biodiversity we have today. And if<br>we look back now in the Nordic Forest, as Jari<br>said, it's growing very slowly, the trees. And<br>that means that biodiversity is also developing<br>only very slowly and it takes time then. And if we<br>go 100 years back in time, we did selective<br>harvests in the Nordic countries. We harvested the<br>big trees and left the small ones behind and --<br>there was also a lot of deadwood then. And the<br>forests became quite low productive. And then<br>those forests were replaced with a large-scale<br>forest tree operations that started in the 1950s,<br>1960s. And thanks to those operations we have<br>today, very well growing forest in the Nordics but<br>also, this was not good for biodiversities because<br>we created large and also homogeneous forests.<br>Since the 1990s, the forestry operations have<br>changed a lot."

That's a great question and<br>takes us right back to the framework itself, our<br>sustainability strategic framework, which,<br>obviously, biodiversity is a key component of in<br>terms of our drivers around creating a healthy<br>planet, healthy people. Biodiversity is a really<br>integral part of our delivery of sustainability<br>through the built environment.

Yes, I will be navigating you<br>through this challenge, which is to try and<br>discover the links between forests, biodiversity<br>and sustainability. So how do these interconnect?<br>Well, shall we discover the answer? Of course,<br>forests and biodiversity seem easy.

And what is the relation? Why are we talking<br>about this when we're talking about paper, about<br>discovery? So I'll try and give you some hints.So<br>-- well, landscapes, as you know, landscapes are<br>home for several types of forests and several<br>types of land users. So in the same landscape<br>level, we can have production planted forests as<br>well as multiple used forest spaces, but also we<br>can have patches of zones with interest for<br>conservation and they may all inhabit the same<br>landscape and be managed together with different<br>objectives -- management objectives. And as long<br>as they are responsibly managed, perhaps, these<br>objectives can come together and bring added value<br>to the landscape itself. So responsible forest<br>management is about what? It's about respecting<br>and harmonizing values, and we're talking about<br>environmental, social and economic values, the 3<br>pillars that underpin the big term sustainability.<br>But we also want to conciliate yields with<br>responsibility."

But this also shows the<br>impact in terms of how many companies or how many<br>forest managers and owners around the world are<br>interested in showing impact through a product<br>that we developed called Ecosystem Services, which<br>captures and helps forest managers to capture the<br>data around ecosystem services in a more<br>methodological way, in a more trusted way and<br>present that to the world in a verified way. And I<br>guess I wanted to come back to the Portuguese<br>forests because of that sourcing in particular. So<br>we talked about scale. Now the forest area in<br>Portugal is around 6.1 million hectares, of which<br>3.2 hectares is kind of is seen as forest. The<br>rest is seen as shrub, unproductive land, which<br>could be restored into forest, which could be left<br>to reward. And that's, of course, up to the<br>Portuguese land use planning to do. But when we<br>talk about the Portuguese forests and how they are<br>made up, the national forest is made up mainly of<br>90 species.

           "Yes. So there was a question on how does the<br>biodiversity in Portuguese forest is assured if<br>there is a strong push towards [indiscernible].<br>And again, my answer is, of course, through the<br>FSC system. How does that work through the FSC<br>system? Well, in the FSC system, all forest<br>owners, managers have to put at least 10% of their<br>management unit of their forest area that they<br>manage aside for something what we call<br>conservation areas. So it's something that -- it's<br>a managed area, but it's managed for conservation<br>and not for production in all of the areas. So if<br>you own or manage 100 hectares of forest, 10<br>hectares of that will have to be -- at least 10<br>hectares of that has to be put aside for<br>conservation purposes. And that is primarily for<br>biodiversity conservation, but also capturing<br>other high conservation values. It can be cultural<br>values, it can be social values as well as<br>environmental values as well. My colleague,<br>Joanna, is helping me on WhatsApp here as well,<br>and she's basically telling me some data from<br>Portugal, which is actually the data from Portugal<br>is that around half of our [indiscernible] areas<br>are without any legal protection. So they wouldn't<br>be concerned for biodiversity if it wasn't for FSC<br>certification in place. And there is no other<br>legal structure that would put those into a<br>biodiversity conservation management. And the<br>average area of conservation areas in Portugal --<br>Portuguese FSC forests is not 10%."

And in the biodiversity area, we have a<br>detailed action plan towards 2030 to achieve a<br>restoration in biodiversity.

           "Thank you, Jari. Hello, everyone. So before coming<br>to Stora Enso in February this year, I spent 25<br>years as a forest scientist. So I have both<br>perspectives from theory and practice on this<br>topic of biodiversity. And in my talk here today,<br>I will first provide a brief line on the subject<br>of biodiversity, putting it a bit in a global<br>context. And then I will take you from there to<br>the Nordic forest. Next slide, please. So<br>biodiversity, it's all about the variability of<br>different biological life forms here on earth. And<br>normally, we talk about biodiversity on 3<br>different levels: on genetic level, on species<br>level and an ecosystem level. And biodiversity has<br>been regulated internationally since 1992 in the<br>UN Convention of Biological Diversity. And the<br>goals of this convention is really to promote<br>biodiversity conservation. It is to ensure<br>sustainable use of this important resource and<br>it's also about fair sharing of the benefits that<br>may arise out of the use of genetic resources.Next<br>slide. So biodiversity is a rather complex topic,<br>I would say. But when we talk about it, daily like<br>we do in media nowadays nearly. Then I think it's<br>mainly 2 arguments that are important to make<br>biodiversity relevant for the public. And the<br>first 1 is about functionality. It's about<br>biodiversities needed to maintain proper ecosystem<br>function."

I am by education a<br>Forester, and I have spent most of my career in<br>forest management and daily forest operations in<br>Stora Enso in different parts of the world. And I<br>would like to share a little with you today how we<br>now will work with continue to develop our<br>biodiversity activities in the forest. So if I --<br>get the next slide, please. So as Annika said,<br>biodiversity is very much about variation and<br>variation in different scales. So when we want to<br>work with biodiversity, we need to work in scales<br>in the landscape in habitats and on species level<br>and do that also throughout the life cycle of the<br>forest. And then as you know, the life cycle of<br>the Nordic forest is somewhere between 70 and 100<br>years. In the '90s, also as Annika mentioned,<br>there was a radical change in how we do<br>sustainable forest management and this we now see<br>solid track records on the development of<br>biodiversity as a consequence of that. But we also<br>want now to increase our activities to be more<br>active and also developed by the biodiversity<br>management, not just to restore it. We foster this<br>with collaboration with universities, NGOs and<br>other stakeholders in society and, of course,<br>driven by all our people out in the forest<br>skilled, skilled people would love to be in the<br>forest and have a big heart for nature and<br>biodiversity as such. And I will give you a couple<br>of examples on how we approach this. So if we take<br>next slide."

But why do we talk so much<br>about biodiversity at this point in time, I think<br>1 important process. I think there's many answers<br>to that question, but I would like to mention 1<br>process, and that is the IPBES process. IPBES is<br>for biodiversity what IPCC is for climate change,<br>I would say. It's about gathering scientists from<br>all over the world to sit down and assess the<br>scientific evidence and come with prescriptions or<br>suggestions for pathways forward to policymakers<br>and to other decision makers. Next slide. But<br>going now from the global to the Nordic forest. I<br>would like to mention first about the red list.<br>The red list is an important tool for the<br>practical biodiversity work that we do. And red<br>list, they are issued country-wise. It's really<br>about the risk of species to become extinct within<br>the specific country. And I will use Sweden as an<br>example. And in Sweden, the latest version of the<br>red list was issued in 2020. And the red lists are<br>also, I should mention, they are according to a<br>system set by the International Union for the<br>consolidation of Nature."

And that is<br>also the species that we will follow going<br>forward. Next. And this is -- I will not go into<br>details in this, but this is the set of indicators<br>and as said they are then selected carefully based<br>on science on so what can be followed, a<br>reasonable to follow-on landscape level, what can<br>be followed on habitat level and what can -- the<br>species will be selected and what is the quality<br>of our work and all this, thus, together will give<br>us a picture on the state. So biodiversity over<br>time, the quality of our work and the active<br>management that we can gradually develop, and we<br>will follow this then over time towards 2050. Next<br>slide, please. Going forward, there is, of course,<br>opportunities for improving our way of working and<br>improving our output, our efficiency. The first<br>one is what we call precision forest or precision<br>biodiversity. It is the possibilities with<br>digitalization, remote sensing, laser scanning,<br>data processing to be more data-driven and by that<br>being more accurate, more granular in the data we<br>have to work into forest and by that also be able<br>to improve our management activities more effic"

Another thing<br>that was perhaps -- or it was very common like 120<br>years ago or 100 years ago in the Nordic<br>landscape. That was cattle grazing in the forest,<br>and cattle create small-scale disturbance that<br>supports different species like particularly<br>vascular plants like orchids, they need this kind<br>of small-scale disturbance to be able to thrive in<br>the forest. Next slide. Before leaving the part to<br>Johan, I would like to mention something about the<br>legacy of previous forest management, that is<br>impacting the biodiversity we have today. And if<br>we look back now in the Nordic Forest, as Jari<br>said, it's growing very slowly, the trees. And<br>that means that biodiversity is also developing<br>only very slowly and it takes time then. And if we<br>go 100 years back in time, we did selective<br>harvests in the Nordic countries. We harvested the<br>big trees and left the small ones behind and --<br>there was also a lot of deadwood then. And the<br>forests became quite low productive. And then<br>those forests were replaced with a large-scale<br>forest tree operations that started in the 1950s,<br>1960s. And thanks to those operations we have<br>today, very well growing forest in the Nordics but<br>also, this was not good for biodiversities because<br>we created large and also homogeneous forests.<br>Since the 1990s, the forestry operations have<br>changed a lot."

This will support our<br>forest management but this will also support fire<br>diversity management.

Decaying wood, different types of deadwood<br>and to promote that, we can create high stands. We<br>cut the trees of 3, 4-meter high and leave a stand<br>that can gradually die and be a good place for<br>insects and birds later on. Retention trees is<br>another area where you keep valuable trees or you<br>keep a group of trees to get shadow into the<br>forest and for example, mosses that Annika talked<br>about need to have more moister conditions in the<br>forest. That's good for them. Some areas should<br>not be touched at all even if they are small<br>areas, they are not reserves, but they are smaller<br>that we keep untouched to promote that type of<br>habitat. And then soil and water, very important<br>to protect the waters from damages and to clean<br>streams, sometimes the faces can move better and<br>more undisturbed and the same. So not destroying<br>the soil as such which tracks and often machines<br>and towards the water steam fields have barriers,<br>buffers also different type of kinds.

If we<br>start with the life cycle of the forest, as<br>Annette mentioned, we breed trees for good growth<br>and for resilience in the future. But out in the<br>forest, it's also about adapting the trees to the<br>right places, time trees on the dryer place parts<br>of the plantation areas and Spruce and Bergamot in<br>the moist and fertile areas. And we also use<br>native trees all the time. In the -- during the<br>life cycle once the forest becomes 30 to 40 years<br>old, it's time for thinning of the forest, and<br>that's the second time when you can influence the<br>biodiversity by selecting trees, keeping deadwood<br>that has occurred and also adjust species<br>composition and promote more to citrus trees into<br>foresting that is a bit limited from beginning.<br>And when you come to the final felling somewhere<br>when the force is 70, 80, 90, 100 years old, it's<br>time to do the planning for the harvesting to<br>maintain or promote the variation in the forest<br>and by that promote biodiversity keep certain<br>pieces of the forest untouched and have special<br>activities to develop more deadwood or retention<br>trees in the hoisting sites. Let's look at the<br>next slide.

That's a great question and<br>takes us right back to the framework itself, our<br>sustainability strategic framework, which,<br>obviously, biodiversity is a key component of in<br>terms of our drivers around creating a healthy<br>planet, healthy people. Biodiversity is a really<br>integral part of our delivery of sustainability<br>through the built environment. And what's really<br>interesting is that over the last few years, we've<br>seen a really big upswing in terms of the need and<br>the demand and the drive to drive increased<br>biodiversity in urban areas, particularly off the<br>back of the strength of our urban regeneration<br>pipeline.

We're excited about the<br>brand-new sort of park area and natural<br>environment elements that we'll be bringing into<br>that project. We've had some great opportunities<br>in Chicago with our Southbank project there to<br>bring back a new sort of foreshore area complete<br>with local and native planting. We've got beehives<br>popping up all over the place, whether they're<br>rooftop gardens, et cetera; and even, too, the<br>work that we've been doing in terms of the<br>research here in Sydney with the impact of<br>planting around the efficiency of solar panels and<br>being able to work to sort of drive research that<br>has proven that to plant in and around solar<br>panels actually increases the efficiency and<br>effectiveness of the power generation there."

They're looking to be -- to have<br>more -- access to more space. So I think it's part<br>of our strategy to meet what is emerging<br>regulation, really, but to try and use it as<br>alongside the branding that we've got for the<br>Heritage product.

And<br>speaking of QMM, a subsidiary of Rio Tinto in<br>Madagascar, the inhabitants of a village named<br>Antsotso are affected by Rio Tinto company<br>biodiversity offsetting. A report published by<br>international NGOs last year has already raised<br>that the community that was already living in<br>precarious situation could not cultivate any<br>longer at the traditional places and had to move<br>far from the village near the seaside where the<br>soil is not fertile, as very sandy, so their crops<br>decreased a lot. In addition, taking some wood<br>inside the forest becomes forbidden so that the<br>villagers cannot build new canoes to fish on the<br>sea when their canoes become older or unusable. In<br>spite of my sharing of these issues with the<br>shareholders here at the last AGM, nothing has<br>been done by the company to correct or improve the<br>situation. That's why a community representative<br>wanted to come to London and to attend the AGM<br>with an interpreter in order to testimony by<br>himself in front of you, of all they are suffering<br>of, and to directly explicit their demands.<br>Unfortunately, they were refused of a visa by the<br>embassy office for scandalous reasons as mentioned<br>in the British newspapers. A video is now<br>available where several villagers explained the<br>negative consequences of this biodiversity<br>offsetting on their lives."

Yes, I will be navigating you<br>through this challenge, which is to try and<br>discover the links between forests, biodiversity<br>and sustainability. So how do these interconnect?<br>Well, shall we discover the answer? Of course,<br>forests and biodiversity seem easy. Sustainability<br>is on the agenda of companies, of people,<br>individuals and the society as a whole. But do we<br>really know the interconnections and how deep this<br>goes. And what is the relation? Why are we talking<br>about this when we're talking about paper, about<br>discovery? So I'll try and give you some hints.So<br>-- well, landscapes, as you know, landscapes are<br>home for several types of forests and several<br>types of land users. So in the same landscape<br>level, we can have production planted forests as<br>well as multiple used forest spaces, but also we<br>can have patches of zones with interest for<br>conservation and they may all inhabit the same<br>landscape and be managed together with different<br>objectives -- management objectives. And as long<br>as they are responsibly managed, perhaps, these<br>objectives can come together and bring added value<br>to the landscape itself. So responsible forest<br>management is about what? It's about respecting<br>and harmonizing values, and we're talking about<br>environmental, social and economic values, the 3<br>pillars that underpin the big term sustainability.<br>But we also want to conciliate yields with<br>responsibility."

So what we want when<br>we're managing forests is to have a no net loss of<br>biodiversity, but as much as possible a net<br>positive gain, so in reaching the area in<br>biodiversity. And how do we do it at The Navigator<br>Company? This is just an example. So we manage<br>more than 107,000 hectares. But not everything is<br>production forests. It's about 75%. All this area<br>is certified both by FSC and PEFC, but we also<br>preserve habitats. We do monitoring of fauna and<br>flora. We have encountered 46 different Natura<br>2000 habitats that we have met and that we<br>protect. We display connectivity features in the<br>field so that this biodiversity is able to<br>complete their functions. And of course, we do<br>several initiatives for forest protection so that<br>we can ensure health and vitality of the forest as<br>a whole. This is what about -- this is what<br>responsible forest management is about, I'm sorry.<br>So this is how we do it. And -- well, how can we<br>relate this with sustainability? Well, the WBCSD<br>has issued the Forest Sector SDG Roadmap, which is<br>a reference document for the companies in the<br>forest sector to maximize their contribution for<br>the sustainable development goals of the United<br>Nations.

The<br>VBDO stands for Dutch Association of Investors for<br>Sustainable Development. And it has been a couple<br>of years now that we've been engaging with Wolters<br>Kluwer this way, and that we're happy to continue<br>that engagement this year as well. And the 3<br>topics we would like to discuss today refer to,<br>number one, is biodiversity; number two is the<br>labor conditions in the value chain; and number<br>three is diversity and inclusion. I hear you<br>thinking about like biodiversity and Wolters<br>Kluwer, could it ever be material? So let me<br>explain why we would like to put this on the<br>agenda this theme. The World Economic Forum has<br>identified in its risk report in 2020 by diversity<br>as one of the top 3 highest risks for companies<br>and for humanity in total. So it is interesting to<br>at least be aware of that risk and to really look<br>into what does it mean for us. Another topic in<br>that area that has recently increased the<br>attention to biodiversity and the value of<br>biodiversity is the EU taxonomy. Also in that<br>taxonomy, there is a lot of attention to<br>biodiversity and its value, its importance. So<br>yes, the reason why we would like to put this on<br>the agenda in the engagement with Wolters Kluwer<br>is that it's an important topic, and it may become<br>a more important topic even than climate change.<br>So let's have a look into that."

So the first one is about biodiversity.<br>And we are, effectively, at this point in time,<br>defining the different steps that we need to take<br>towards what I would say a better management of<br>the biodiversity impact of what we do.  We have<br>defined 5 steps. So the first one is to identify<br>the zones that are at risk, starting with our own<br>footprint, our own site. When we've done that step<br>1, then we go to step 2, which is to measure and<br>qualify the actual impact in each of these risk<br>area. The third step then would be to define the<br>action plans to prevent, manage and eventually<br>remediate some of these risks. Step 4 in the way<br>we've aligned it in our plan is then to monitor,<br>but also report on the implementation of the<br>action plans.

And we can<br>say that none of our sites are in a risk area. But<br>there is 1 site which is in a key biodiversity<br>area. So now we need to conduct the other steps.<br>Step 2 and step 3, we believe that we should be<br>able to do that before the end of 2023. And by the<br>end of 2025, we should be done with the 5 steps,<br>including also the external part, which is the use<br>phase and our supply chain."

So I have both<br>perspectives from theory and practice on this<br>topic of biodiversity. And in my talk here today,<br>I will first provide a brief line on the subject<br>of biodiversity, putting it a bit in a global<br>context. And then I will take you from there to<br>the Nordic forest. Next slide, please. So<br>biodiversity, it's all about the variability of<br>different biological life forms here on earth. And<br>normally, we talk about biodiversity on 3<br>different levels: on genetic level, on species<br>level and an ecosystem level. And biodiversity has<br>been regulated internationally since 1992 in the<br>UN Convention of Biological Diversity. And the<br>goals of this convention is really to promote<br>biodiversity conservation. It is to ensure<br>sustainable use of this important resource and<br>it's also about fair sharing of the benefits that<br>may arise out of the use of genetic resources.Next<br>slide. So biodiversity is a rather complex topic,<br>I would say. But when we talk about it, daily like<br>we do in media nowadays nearly. Then I think it's<br>mainly 2 arguments that are important to make<br>biodiversity relevant for the public. And the<br>first 1 is about functionality. It's about<br>biodiversities needed to maintain proper ecosystem<br>function."

And then the other sort<br>of argument that is often raised, it's about the<br>moral dimension, but we need to conserve<br>biodiversity to respect all different life forms<br>on earth. Next slide. But why do we talk so much<br>about biodiversity at this point in time, I think<br>1 important process. I think there's many answers<br>to that question, but I would like to mention 1<br>process, and that is the IPBES process. IPBES is<br>for biodiversity what IPCC is for climate change,<br>I would say. It's about gathering scientists from<br>all over the world to sit down and assess the<br>scientific evidence and come with prescriptions or<br>suggestions for pathways forward to policymakers<br>and to other decision makers. Next slide. But<br>going now from the global to the Nordic forest. I<br>would like to mention first about the red list.<br>The red list is an important tool for the<br>practical biodiversity work that we do. And red<br>list, they are issued country-wise. It's really<br>about the risk of species to become extinct within<br>the specific country. And I will use Sweden as an<br>example. And in Sweden, the latest version of the<br>red list was issued in 2020. And the red lists are<br>also, I should mention, they are according to a<br>system set by the International Union for the<br>consolidation of Nature."

Decaying wood, different types of deadwood<br>and to promote that, we can create high stands. We<br>cut the trees of 3, 4-meter high and leave a stand<br>that can gradually die and be a good place for<br>insects and birds later on. Retention trees is<br>another area where you keep valuable trees or you<br>keep a group of trees to get shadow into the<br>forest and for example, mosses that Annika talked<br>about need to have more moister conditions in the<br>forest. That's good for them. Some areas should<br>not be touched at all even if they are small<br>areas, they are not reserves, but they are smaller<br>that we keep untouched to promote that type of<br>habitat. And then soil and water, very important<br>to protect the waters from damages and to clean<br>streams, sometimes the faces can move better and<br>more undisturbed and the same. So not destroying<br>the soil as such which tracks and often machines<br>and towards the water steam fields have barriers,<br>buffers also different type of kinds.

I am by education a<br>Forester, and I have spent most of my career in<br>forest management and daily forest operations in<br>Stora Enso in different parts of the world. And I<br>would like to share a little with you today how we<br>now will work with continue to develop our<br>biodiversity activities in the forest. So if I --<br>get the next slide, please. So as Annika said,<br>biodiversity is very much about variation and<br>variation in different scales. So when we want to<br>work with biodiversity, we need to work in scales<br>in the landscape in habitats and on species level<br>and do that also throughout the life cycle of the<br>forest. And then as you know, the life cycle of<br>the Nordic forest is somewhere between 70 and 100<br>years. In the '90s, also as Annika mentioned,<br>there was a radical change in how we do<br>sustainable forest management and this we now see<br>solid track records on the development of<br>biodiversity as a consequence of that. But we also<br>want now to increase our activities to be more<br>active and also developed by the biodiversity<br>management, not just to restore it. We foster this<br>with collaboration with universities, NGOs and<br>other stakeholders in society and, of course,<br>driven by all our people out in the forest<br>skilled, skilled people would love to be in the<br>forest and have a big heart for nature and<br>biodiversity as such.

So it's not<br>just like creating deadwood would solve the<br>problem like this. It's about having the wood<br>slowly decomposing to make all these different<br>structures and habitats that are important for<br>different species. Another feature, very important<br>in the Nordic Forest is the water and water,<br>naturally flowing water in these landscapes, they<br>create moisture gradients and fertility gradients<br>that also contributes to this variation that we<br>need to enhance biodiversity. Next slide. But it's<br>not only natural processes that creates<br>biodiversity, we can also help nature to create<br>biodiversity. And here, I show 2 examples. One is<br>about fire because we are nowadays very good at<br>preventing fires to occur in the forest. We have<br>not so many and not so large fires. And that is a<br>problem for species that are totally dependent on<br>fires. And we have different vascular plants that<br>need fires for the seeds to grow. And we also have<br>insects that are dependent on deadwood from fire<br>to be able to complete their life cycles. So what<br>we do in forest today is controlled burnings, to<br>enhance the sort of structures and habitats that<br>these species require. Another thing that was<br>perhaps -- or it was very common like 120 years<br>ago or 100 years ago in the Nordic landscape."

Next slide. Before leaving the part to<br>Johan, I would like to mention something about the<br>legacy of previous forest management, that is<br>impacting the biodiversity we have today. And if<br>we look back now in the Nordic Forest, as Jari<br>said, it's growing very slowly, the trees. And<br>that means that biodiversity is also developing<br>only very slowly and it takes time then. And if we<br>go 100 years back in time, we did selective<br>harvests in the Nordic countries. We harvested the<br>big trees and left the small ones behind and --<br>there was also a lot of deadwood then. And the<br>forests became quite low productive. And then<br>those forests were replaced with a large-scale<br>forest tree operations that started in the 1950s,<br>1960s. And thanks to those operations we have<br>today, very well growing forest in the Nordics but<br>also, this was not good for biodiversities because<br>we created large and also homogeneous forests.<br>Since the 1990s, the forestry operations have<br>changed a lot."

And for the future,<br>these trees will contribute to the structural<br>variation that the forest that is coming will be<br>part of, so to say.

Yes, I will be navigating you<br>through this challenge, which is to try and<br>discover the links between forests, biodiversity<br>and sustainability. So how do these interconnect?<br>Well, shall we discover the answer? Of course,<br>forests and biodiversity seem easy. Sustainability<br>is on the agenda of companies, of people,<br>individuals and the society as a whole. But do we<br>really know the interconnections and how deep this<br>goes. And what is the relation? Why are we talking<br>about this when we're talking about paper, about<br>discovery? So I'll try and give you some hints.So<br>-- well, landscapes, as you know, landscapes are<br>home for several types of forests and several<br>types of land users. So in the same landscape<br>level, we can have production planted forests as<br>well as multiple used forest spaces, but also we<br>can have patches of zones with interest for<br>conservation and they may all inhabit the same<br>landscape and be managed together with different<br>objectives -- management objectives. And as long<br>as they are responsibly managed, perhaps, these<br>objectives can come together and bring added value<br>to the landscape itself. So responsible forest<br>management is about what? It's about respecting<br>and harmonizing values, and we're talking about<br>environmental, social and economic values, the 3<br>pillars that underpin the big term sustainability.<br>But we also want to conciliate yields with<br>responsibility."

And you can<br>see the different scale of reach of FSC<br>certification. In terms of forests impact, this is<br>the key one, the FM areas, the forest management<br>areas, that are impacted. But this also shows the<br>impact in terms of how many companies or how many<br>forest managers and owners around the world are<br>interested in showing impact through a product<br>that we developed called Ecosystem Services, which<br>captures and helps forest managers to capture the<br>data around ecosystem services in a more<br>methodological way, in a more trusted way and<br>present that to the world in a verified way. And I<br>guess I wanted to come back to the Portuguese<br>forests because of that sourcing in particular. So<br>we talked about scale. Now the forest area in<br>Portugal is around 6.1 million hectares, of which<br>3.2 hectares is kind of is seen as forest. The<br>rest is seen as shrub, unproductive land, which<br>could be restored into forest, which could be left<br>to reward. And that's, of course, up to the<br>Portuguese land use planning to do. But when we<br>talk about the Portuguese forests and how they are<br>made up, the national forest is made up mainly of<br>90 species.

So there was a question on how does the<br>biodiversity in Portuguese forest is assured if<br>there is a strong push towards [indiscernible].<br>And again, my answer is, of course, through the<br>FSC system. How does that work through the FSC<br>system? Well, in the FSC system, all forest<br>owners, managers have to put at least 10% of their<br>management unit of their forest area that they<br>manage aside for something what we call<br>conservation areas. So it's something that -- it's<br>a managed area, but it's managed for conservation<br>and not for production in all of the areas. So if<br>you own or manage 100 hectares of forest, 10<br>hectares of that will have to be -- at least 10<br>hectares of that has to be put aside for<br>conservation purposes. And that is primarily for<br>biodiversity conservation, but also capturing<br>other high conservation values. It can be cultural<br>values, it can be social values as well as<br>environmental values as well. My colleague,<br>Joanna, is helping me on WhatsApp here as well,<br>and she's basically telling me some data from<br>Portugal, which is actually the data from Portugal<br>is that around half of our [indiscernible] areas<br>are without any legal protection. So they wouldn't<br>be concerned for biodiversity if it wasn't for FSC<br>certification in place. And there is no other<br>legal structure that would put those into a<br>biodiversity conservation management. And the<br>average area of conservation areas in Portugal --<br>Portuguese FSC forests is not 10%."

So the first one is about biodiversity.<br>And we are, effectively, at this point in time,<br>defining the different steps that we need to take<br>towards what I would say a better management of<br>the biodiversity impact of what we do.  We have<br>defined 5 steps. So the first one is to identify<br>the zones that are at risk, starting with our own<br>footprint, our own site. When we've done that step<br>1, then we go to step 2, which is to measure and<br>qualify the actual impact in each of these risk<br>area. The third step then would be to define the<br>action plans to prevent, manage and eventually<br>remediate some of these risks. Step 4 in the way<br>we've aligned it in our plan is then to monitor,<br>but also report on the implementation of the<br>action plans.

And we can<br>say that none of our sites are in a risk area. But<br>there is 1 site which is in a key biodiversity<br>area. So now we need to conduct the other steps.<br>Step 2 and step 3, we believe that we should be<br>able to do that before the end of 2023.

Actually, they work with us<br>and many other universities.

In order to meet this commitment,<br>we've also taken a number of actions to engage<br>internally and externally. Let me give you a few<br>examples of those. In 2020, we launched HSBC<br>Pollination Climate Asset Management, and this was<br>done to establish natural capital as an asset<br>class with a corresponding market value. Secondly,<br>as an example, we were the first private investor<br>in The Reef Credit Scheme, which incentivizes<br>farmers and graziers in Queensland, Australia for<br>actions that they take to reduce their impact on<br>the Great Barrier Reef. And we also recently<br>announced the climate solutions partnership with<br>the World Wildlife Fund and the World Resources<br>Institute, which aims to scale solutions that<br>protect and restore nature, and this is supported<br>by USD 100 million over 5 years of philanthropic<br>funding by"

           "Thank you, Jari. Hello, everyone. So before coming<br>to Stora Enso in February this year, I spent 25<br>years as a forest scientist. So I have both<br>perspectives from theory and practice on this<br>topic of biodiversity. And in my talk here today,<br>I will first provide a brief line on the subject<br>of biodiversity, putting it a bit in a global<br>context. And then I will take you from there to<br>the Nordic forest. Next slide, please. So<br>biodiversity, it's all about the variability of<br>different biological life forms here on earth. And<br>normally, we talk about biodiversity on 3<br>different levels: on genetic level, on species<br>level and an ecosystem level. And biodiversity has<br>been regulated internationally since 1992 in the<br>UN Convention of Biological Diversity. And the<br>goals of this convention is really to promote<br>biodiversity conservation. It is to ensure<br>sustainable use of this important resource and<br>it's also about fair sharing of the benefits that<br>may arise out of the use of genetic resources.Next<br>slide. So biodiversity is a rather complex topic,<br>I would say. But when we talk about it, daily like<br>we do in media nowadays nearly. Then I think it's<br>mainly 2 arguments that are important to make<br>biodiversity relevant for the public. And the<br>first 1 is about functionality. It's about<br>biodiversities needed to maintain proper ecosystem<br>function."

And I<br>would like to share a little with you today how we<br>now will work with continue to develop our<br>biodiversity activities in the forest. So if I --<br>get the next slide, please. So as Annika said,<br>biodiversity is very much about variation and<br>variation in different scales. So when we want to<br>work with biodiversity, we need to work in scales<br>in the landscape in habitats and on species level<br>and do that also throughout the life cycle of the<br>forest. And then as you know, the life cycle of<br>the Nordic forest is somewhere between 70 and 100<br>years. In the '90s, also as Annika mentioned,<br>there was a radical change in how we do<br>sustainable forest management and this we now see<br>solid track records on the development of<br>biodiversity as a consequence of that. But we also<br>want now to increase our activities to be more<br>active and also developed by the biodiversity<br>management, not just to restore it. We foster this<br>with collaboration with universities, NGOs and<br>other stakeholders in society and, of course,<br>driven by all our people out in the forest<br>skilled, skilled people would love to be in the<br>forest and have a big heart for nature and<br>biodiversity as such.

I think there's many answers<br>to that question, but I would like to mention 1<br>process, and that is the IPBES process.

It's really<br>about the risk of species to become extinct within<br>the specific country. And I will use Sweden as an<br>example.

Another thing<br>that was perhaps -- or it was very common like 120<br>years ago or 100 years ago in the Nordic<br>landscape. That was cattle grazing in the forest,<br>and cattle create small-scale disturbance that<br>supports different species like particularly<br>vascular plants like orchids, they need this kind<br>of small-scale disturbance to be able to thrive in<br>the forest. Next slide. Before leaving the part to<br>Johan, I would like to mention something about the<br>legacy of previous forest management, that is<br>impacting the biodiversity we have today. And if<br>we look back now in the Nordic Forest, as Jari<br>said, it's growing very slowly, the trees. And<br>that means that biodiversity is also developing<br>only very slowly and it takes time then. And if we<br>go 100 years back in time, we did selective<br>harvests in the Nordic countries. We harvested the<br>big trees and left the small ones behind and --<br>there was also a lot of deadwood then. And the<br>forests became quite low productive. And then<br>those forests were replaced with a large-scale<br>forest tree operations that started in the 1950s,<br>1960s. And thanks to those operations we have<br>today, very well growing forest in the Nordics but<br>also, this was not good for biodiversities because<br>we created large and also homogeneous forests.<br>Since the 1990s, the forestry operations have<br>changed a lot."

Decaying wood, different types of deadwood<br>and to promote that, we can create high stands. We<br>cut the trees of 3, 4-meter high and leave a stand<br>that can gradually die and be a good place for<br>insects and birds later on. Retention trees is<br>another area where you keep valuable trees or you<br>keep a group of trees to get shadow into the<br>forest and for example, mosses that Annika talked<br>about need to have more moister conditions in the<br>forest. That's good for them. Some areas should<br>not be touched at all even if they are small<br>areas, they are not reserves, but they are smaller<br>that we keep untouched to promote that type of<br>habitat. And then soil and water, very important<br>to protect the waters from damages and to clean<br>streams, sometimes the faces can move better and<br>more undisturbed and the same. So not destroying<br>the soil as such which tracks and often machines<br>and towards the water steam fields have barriers,<br>buffers also different type of kinds.

In the -- during the<br>life cycle once the forest becomes 30 to 40 years<br>old, it's time for thinning of the forest, and<br>that's the second time when you can influence the<br>biodiversity by selecting trees, keeping deadwood<br>that has occurred and also adjust species<br>composition and promote more to citrus trees into<br>foresting that is a bit limited from beginning.<br>And when you come to the final felling somewhere<br>when the force is 70, 80, 90, 100 years old, it's<br>time to do the planning for the harvesting to<br>maintain or promote the variation in the forest<br>and by that promote biodiversity keep certain<br>pieces of the forest untouched and have special<br>activities to develop more deadwood or retention<br>trees in the hoisting sites.

This is, of course, elevated also<br>the importance of Forest sustainability. And this<br>has been playing also vital role in our strategy<br>work. And there the special focus has been then<br>the topic for today, which is biodiversity. And<br>due to well-known reasons, public affairs is<br>playing vital role for us and forest<br>sustainability and public affairs are strongly<br>connected. One additional topic I would like to<br>share, especially with you is the stakeholder<br>views. So we want to understand and we want to<br>consider in future better external stakeholder<br>views. And I'm so much waiting for the discussions<br>today and going forward to get your feedback and<br>your contribution in this field. So let's go to<br>the next slide."

By the end of 2020, we had achieved the goal<br>with emission reduces by over 580,000 tonnes. So<br>early this year, we create a new target to reduce<br>our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by a further 30% or<br>730,000 tonnes by 2025. And also in the long term,<br>we have committed to being carbon neutral by 2050<br>at the latest in line with Chile's own targets.<br>Regarding Scope 3, we will continue to measure and<br>report it, and we are working, setting a reduction<br>target. We are managing the environment and<br>biodiversity near our operations, not only to<br>reduce our impact, but in some areas to enhance it<br>by managing a special nature sanctuaries. Actions<br>speak louder than words. And so I want to show you<br>and this is like 4 example of biodiversity<br>programs that we have established it. At Santa<br>Inés, we are protecting a relict forest of<br>olivillo, which survives due to specific climatic<br>conditions in this semi-desert area. At Monte<br>Aranda, there are Chilean palms, a threatened<br>endemic species. And Lake Conchalí is a coastal<br>wetland with a high diversity of bird species, and<br>is the first private RAMSAR site in the country.<br>And in Quebrada Llau-Llau, there is a<br>sclerophyllous forest, which has a rich<br>biodiversity.

We're aware of the biodiversity fix<br>in this project. We have an African culture at<br>Total. So we are very much aware of this. And we<br>know that part of this development, the Murchison<br>Falls Park is involved. We're actually talking<br>about 0.04% of the park entry. But there were<br>studies that were carried out. And I'm committing<br>for this project. I'm committing to the fact that<br>we'll have a net gain in terms of biodiversity at<br>the end of the project. Biodiversity is an<br>essential aspect. Net gain. What do I mean by<br>that? When investing in this type of project,<br>Total project, but any industrial project on-site<br>for any activity, we will have an impact on the<br>environment. So we carried out all the studies<br>necessary in order to assess the current<br>situation. Of course, we will try as much as<br>possible to avoid any impact and then minimize the<br>impact and then reduce and compensate offsets. So<br>this is our ERC biodiversity: avoid, reduce,<br>minimize, offset. Of course, first is about<br>avoiding the impact. There will be an impact.<br>We've carried out the studies. They were shared by<br>many stakeholders. These studies took about 4<br>years to be carried out.

           "Andy, I'll pick up the one on The Wildlife Trusts<br>initiative, really. It's probably worth saying<br>that we've been working with The Wildlife Trusts<br>now for a couple of years or so. Of course, what<br>you need to put this into context with is that the<br>environmental bill requires a net biodiversity<br>gain on development, and that's coming through the<br>planning system. So to be quite frank, we're<br>trying to be proactive with it rather than<br>reactive. We don't want to be dragged to have to<br>do things. We're looking at the best solutions to<br>make sure that we've got net gain.We also think<br>that picking up perhaps on some of Matthew's<br>points, social change, people are looking to be<br>closer to nature. They're looking to be -- to have<br>more -- access to more space. So I think it's part<br>of our strategy to meet what is emerging<br>regulation, really, but to try and use it as<br>alongside the branding that we've got for the<br>Heritage product. In term you mentioned costs, I<br>think achieving net biodiversity gain does vary<br>quite a lot from site to site. I run it clear.<br>It's more difficult to achieve on a brownfield<br>site than it is on an agricultural site that has<br>been farmed for years and years and years. So it's<br>quite difficult to be specific about the costs.<br>But ultimately, of course, it gets taken into<br>account at the land appraisal stage. So hopefully,<br>that gives you the answer you're looking for."

So it's going to<br>be embedded in a system where managers make<br>decisions whether to fly or not, these costs will<br>be fully embedded in their decisions. And then<br>biodiversity, big topic. I think a lot of people<br>are aware that this is a huge challenge, but it's<br>also a huge challenge to make it more visible,<br>tangible and link it to the economy. So we have<br>put a lot of effort into this. We basically looked<br>at the whole world. This is Geo coded, so in the<br>whole world.

I saw your e-mail by<br>the way, so we'll try to make it in May. That's<br>one aspect. The second aspect is I've been on many<br>sites in the last 12 months, but have not had the<br>opportunity to go to Madagascar yet, and I can<br>promise to you, I intend to go there pretty soon.<br>So I want to see it with my own eyes as I did with<br>ERA last year. On the biodiversity offset because<br>that's what the question is about, so maybe I<br>should step back and explain what the biodiversity<br>offset means for everybody. In very, very simple<br>terms, it means that we offset, we compensate for<br>biodiversity losses we've gained somewhere else. I<br>know as Jan said, it can be controversial in some<br>quarters, all right? From a Rio standpoint, as of<br>today, we've got around 19 offset project<br>globally, including Madagascar. 84%, we checked<br>the numbers, 84% today are requirements by the<br>government in relation to permittings. There are a<br>couple of them which are requirements from the<br>lenders. So for example, in Mongolia, we have been<br>requested when we put the $4.4 billion of project<br>finance last year to run a series of offset<br>programs and so on and so forth. But I want to say<br>that before we consider any offset project, is<br>really the last resort, if I may put it this way."
